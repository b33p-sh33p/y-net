# y-net

y-net is a site I made in order to help students regain their freedom.

#### Information

Birthdate: September 20, 2019

Inspired by TitaniumPhoenix, however it is built from scratch.

#### Backstory

One day an ordinary student who happened to be me thought, "Why can't students have more privacy?" And thus, y-net was born.

# Features offered

#### Music

There is a small selection of music handpicked by me, but I plan to expand on it.

#### Games

I am currently adding games to y-net. I do not plan to add any Flash games due to the EOL of Adobe Flash in 2020.

#### Tutorials

There are also tutorials on how to do stuff.

#### And more to come soon!
